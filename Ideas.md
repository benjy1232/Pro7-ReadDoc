- MOST IMPORTANTLY MAKE THIS THING MULTIPLATFORM
- Make it a blazor webapp to be run locally on the machine with propresenter - Therefore built with C#
- Read a pages document (prioritizing bc conditions at church), then a docx and finally odt
- pages may be a mac only thing because of uncertainty with how it works
- Odt may be the first one I don't know yet

- For later filter song lyrics through filters and add them to a playlist - probably a different project
